---

## Issue Summary:

- **Duration:**
  - *Start Time*: March 4, 2024, 07:30 UTC
  - *End Time*: March 4, 2024, 19:45 UTC

- **Impact:**
  - Our website took an unscheduled siesta, leaving users stuck in a digital traffic jam for 12 long hours.
  - Users experienced a rollercoaster ride of slow page load times and sporadic errors.
  - Approximately 30% of our users joined the "Wait-a-thon," resulting in a thrilling nosedive in user engagement.

## Timeline:

- **Detection:**
  - *March 4, 2024, 18:30 UTC*: Our monitoring system played the role of Sherlock Holmes and detected the issue – slow response times and errors were the culprits.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Engineers sprang into action faster than caffeinated squirrels.
  - Initial assumption: A surprise visit from a traffic tsunami due to a marketing campaign.
  - Investigated the usual suspects: database server, web servers, and the "Balancing Act" (load balancer).

- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Started a wild goose chase by optimizing database queries and throwing more web server instances into the party.
  - Scaling resources felt like adding more horsepower to a snail - it didn't help.
  - Questioned network cables, but they swore they were innocent.

- **Escalation:**
  - After two hours, we had to wake up the senior infrastructure team from their beauty sleep.

- **Resolution:**
  - Finally, we unmasked the villain - a misconfigured Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule.
  - The WAF was party-pooping by blocking genuine traffic, leading to our servers working overtime.
  - Fixed the rogue WAF rule and held a peace summit with our servers.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

- **Root Cause:**
  - The culprit was an overly enthusiastic Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule that mistook good users for bad actors.
  - This rule sparked chaos, making our servers play a game of digital whack-a-mole.

- **Resolution:**
  - We silenced the misconfigured WAF rule to bring back the digital harmony.
  - To ensure this doesn't happen again, we decided to double-check all WAF rules for sanity.
  - New surveillance systems were deployed to spot rogue WAF rules early.

---

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - We've instituted a WAF rule code review process, making sure they don't have too much caffeine.
  - Created a playbook for WAF-related emergencies, so we're better prepared next time.
  - Upgraded our monitoring arsenal to detect any WAF rule misbehavior.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Conducted an exorcism on all existing WAF rules, removing the unruly ones.
  - Introduced a "Staging Area" for WAF rule changes to practice safe rule deployment.
  - Taught our ops team to recognize WAF rule mischief and act accordingly.
